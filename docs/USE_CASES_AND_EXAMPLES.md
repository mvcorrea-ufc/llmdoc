# LLMDocs - Use Cases and Practical Examples

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

This document provides real-world use cases showing how LLMDocs should intelligently process human descriptions and automatically create the appropriate documentation components. The system acts as an intelligent documentation assistant that understands context and creates structured data from natural language.

---

## ðŸš€ Use Case 1: Project Initialization from Description

### Human Input
```
"I'm starting a new e-commerce platform called 'ShopFlow'. It will have user authentication, product catalog with search, shopping cart, payment processing via Stripe, order management, and an admin dashboard. The tech stack will be React frontend, Node.js backend, PostgreSQL database, and Redis for caching. We plan to deploy on AWS using Docker containers."
```

### Expected System Behavior
The system should automatically create:

#### 1. Project Components
```bash
# System automatically executes:
llmdocs component add '{

## ðŸ›  Use Case 2: Feature Request Processing

### Human Input
```
"We need to add a product recommendation system to the e-commerce platform. It should analyze user behavior, purchase history, and similar user patterns to suggest relevant products. The system should show recommendations on the product detail page, cart page, and after checkout. We'll need to track user interactions, implement collaborative filtering algorithms, and ensure recommendations update in real-time. This should be completed in the next sprint."
```

### Expected System Behavior

#### 1. Analyze and Create Tasks

}'
```

---

## ðŸ”„ Use Case 3: Bug Report Processing

### Human Input
```
"Users are reporting that the shopping cart loses items when they navigate away from the page and come back. This seems to happen especially on mobile devices. The cart should persist items across browser sessions and page refreshes. This is causing customers to abandon their purchases."
```

### Expected System Behavior

#### 1. Create Bug Task
```bash
# System automatically creates bug with appropriate details:
llmdocs task add '{
  "id": "TASK-012",
  "title": "Shopping Cart Items Lost on Navigation",

}'
```

## ðŸŽ¨ Use Case 4: Technical Specification Processing

### Human Input
```
"We need to implement real-time notifications for order status updates. When an order status changes (placed, confirmed, shipped, delivered), customers should receive immediate notifications via email and push notifications. The system should support notification preferences, allowing users to choose which events they want to be notified about and through which channels. We should use WebSockets for real-time updates and integrate with SendGrid for emails and Firebase for push notifications."
```

### Expected System Behavior

#### 1. Create New Components

## ðŸ”§ System Intelligence Features

### Automatic Context Understanding
The system should demonstrate intelligence by:

1. **Component Recognition**: Identifying which components are affected by a description
2. **Task Hierarchy**: Creating appropriate parent-child relationships
3. **Priority Assessment**: Setting priorities based on impact keywords (critical, slow, user complaints)
4. **Sprint Planning**: Automatically adding urgent items to current sprint
5. **Cross-Reference**: Linking related ADRs, tasks, and components
6. **Story Point Estimation**: Using historical data and complexity indicators

### Natural Language Processing Capabilities
The system should extract:

- **Technical Requirements**: APIs, databases, frameworks
- **Business Logic**: User workflows, business rules
- **Quality Attributes**: Performance, security, usability requirements
- **Dependencies**: Component relationships and integration points
- **Urgency Indicators**: Critical, urgent, affecting users, business impact

### Intelligent Categorization
Based on input patterns, the system should:

- **Epic vs Task**: Long descriptions with multiple components â†’ Epic
- **Bug vs Feature**: Problem descriptions â†’ Bug, new functionality â†’ Feature
- **Spike vs Task**: Investigation/research keywords â†’ Spike
- **ADR Triggers**: Architecture, technology choice, scalability â†’ ADR needed

---

## ðŸŽ¬ Example Interaction Flow

### Human Says:
```
"The mobile app crashes when users try to upload profile pictures larger than 2MB. We should implement image compression and validation before upload, and also add a loading indicator during the upload process."
```

### System Processes:
1. **Identifies**: Bug (crashes), Feature (compression, validation, loading)
2. **Components**: Mobile app, image upload service, user profile
3. **Priority**: High (crashes affect users)
4. **Creates**: Bug task + Feature tasks + Investigation spike

### System Outputs:
```bash
# Main bug task
llmdocs task add '{
  "id": "TASK-025",
  "title": "Mobile App Crashes on Large Image Upload",
  "type": "bug",
  "description": "App crashes when users upload profile pictures larger than 2MB",
  "status": "todo",
  "priority": "high",
  "component_ids": ["COMP-001"],
  "labels": ["mobile", "crash", "upload", "images"]
}'

# Feature tasks for solution
llmdocs task add '{
  "id": "TASK-026", 
  "title": "Implement Image Compression Before Upload",
  "type": "feature",
  "description": "Add client-side image compression to reduce file sizes before upload",
  "status": "todo",
  "priority": "high",
  "parent_id": "TASK-025",
  "story_points": 5
}'

llmdocs task add '{
  "id": "TASK-027",

  "story_points": 3
}'
```

This intelligent processing allows teams to focus on building while the system handles the documentation structure automatically.
